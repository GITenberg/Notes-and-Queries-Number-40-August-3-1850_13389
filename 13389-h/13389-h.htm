<h2>NOTES.</h2>
<h3>TRANSLATIONS OF JUVENAL&mdash;WORDSWORTH.</h3>
<p>Mr. Markland's ascertainment (Vol. i., p. 481.) of the origin of
Johnson's "From China to Peru," where, however, I sincerely believe
our great moralist intended not so much to borrow the phrase as to
profit by its temporary notoriety and popularity, reminds me of a
conversation, many years since, with the late William Wordsworth,
at which I happened to be present, and which now derives an
additional interest from the circumstance of his recent
decease.</p>
<p>Some mention had been made of the opening lines of the tenth
satire of Juvenal:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Omnibus in terris, quae sunt a Gadibus usque</p>
<p>Auroram, et Gangem pauci dignoscere possunt</p>
<p>Vera bona, atque illis multum diversa, remot&acirc;</p>
<p>Erroris nebul&acirc;."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Johnson's translation of this," said Wordsworth, "is extremely
bad:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'Let Observation, with extensive view,</p>
<p>Survey mankind from China to Peru.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"And I do not know that Gifford's is at all better:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'In every clime, from Ganges' distant stream,</p>
<p>To Gades, gilded by the western beam,</p>
<p>Few, from the clouds of mental error free,</p>
<p>In its true light, or good or evil see.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"But", he added, musing, "what is Dryden's? Ha! I have it:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'<i>Look round the habitable world</i>, how few</p>
<p>Know their own good, or, knowing it, pursue.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"This is indeed the language of a poet; it is better than the
original."</p>
<p>The great majority of your readers will without doubt, consider
this compliment to Dryden well and justly bestowed, and his
version, besides having the merit of classical expression, to be at
once concise and poetical. And pity it is that one who could form
so true an estimate of the excellences of other writers, and whose
own powers, it will be acknowledged, were of a very high order,
should so often have given us reason to regret his puerilities and
absurdities. This language, perhaps, will sound like treason to
many; but permit me to give an instance in which the late
poet-laureate seems to have admitted (which he did not often do)
that he was wrong.</p>
<p>In the first edition of the poem of Peter Bell (the genuine, and
not the pseudo-Peter), London, 8vo. 1819, that personage sets to
work to bang the poor ass, the result of which is this, p. 36.:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Among the rocks and winding crags&mdash;</p>
<p>Among the mountains far away&mdash;</p>
<p>Once more the ass did lengthen out</p>
<p>More ruefully an endless shout,</p>
<p>The long dry see-saw of his horrible bray."</p>
</div>
</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id=
"page146"></a>{146}</span>
<p>After remarks on Peter's strange state of mind when saluted by
this horrible music, and describing him as preparing to seize the
ass by the neck, we are told his purpose was interrupted by
something he just then saw in the water, which afterwards proves to
be a corpse. The reader is, however, first excited and disposed to
expect something horrible by the following startling
conjectures:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Is it the moon's distorted face?</p>
<p>The ghost-like image of a cloud?</p>
<p>Is it a gallows these pourtrayed?</p>
<p>Is Peter of himself afraid?</p>
<p>Is it a coffin&mdash;or a shroud?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A grisly idol hewn in stone?</p>
<p>Or imp from witch's lap let fall?</p>
<p>Or a gay ring of shining fairies,</p>
<p>Such as pursue their brisk vagaries</p>
<p>In sylvan bower or haunted hall?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Is it a fiend that to a stake</p>
<p>Of fire his desperate self is tethering?</p>
<p>Or stubborn spirit doomed to yell</p>
<p>In solitary ward or cell,</p>
<p>Ten thousand miles from all his brethren."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Is it a party in a parlour?</p>
<p>Cramm'd just as they on earth revere cramm'd&mdash;</p>
<p>Some sipping punch, some sipping tea,</p>
<p>But, as you by their faces see,</p>
<p>All silent and all damn'd!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A throbbing pulse the gazer hath," &amp;c.</p>
<p class="i10">Part i., pp. 33, 39.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This last stanza was omitted in subsequent editions. Indeed, it
is not very easy to imagine what it could possibly mean, or how any
stretch of imagination could connect it with the appearance
presented by a body in the water.</p>
<p>To return, however, from this digression to the subject of
translations. In the passage already quoted, the reader has been
presented with a proof how well Dryden could compress the words,
without losing the sense, of his author. In the following, he has
done precisely the reverse.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Lectus erat Codro Procula minor."&mdash;<i>Juv. Sat.</i> iii.
203.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Codrus had but one bed, so short to boot,</p>
<p>That his short wife's short legs hung dangling out!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the year 1801 there was published at Oxford, in 12mo., a
translation of the satires of Juvenal in verse, by Mr. William
Rhodes, A.M., superior Bedell of Arts in that University, which he
describes in his title-page as "nec verbum verbo." There are some
prefatory remarks prefixed to the third satire in which he
says:</p>
<p>"The reader, I hope, will neither contrast the following, nor
the tenth satire, with the excellent imitation of a mighty genius;
though similar, they are upon a different plan. I have not adhered
rigidly to my author, compared with him; and if that were not the
case, I am very sensible how little they are calculated to undergo
so fiery an ordeal."</p>
<p>And speaking particularly of the third satire, he adds:</p>
<p>"This part has been altered, as already mentioned, to render it
more applicable to London: nothing is to be looked for in it but
the ill-humour of the emigrant."</p>
<p>The reader will perhaps recollect, that in the opening of the
third satire, Juvenal represents himself about to take leave of his
friends Umbritius, who is quitting Rome for Can&aelig;: they meet
on the road (the Via Appia), and turning aside, for greater freedom
of conversation, into the Vallis Egeri&aelig;, the sight of the
fountain there, newly decorated with foreign marbles, leads to an
expression of regret that it was no longer suffered to remain in
the simplicity of the times of Numa:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"In valem Egeri&aelig; descendimus, et speluncas</p>
<p>Dissimiles veris. Quanto pr&aelig;stantius esset</p>
<p>Numen aqu&aelig;, viridi si margine clauderet undas</p>
<p>Herba, nec ingenuum violarent marmora tophum?"</p>
<p class="i10"><i>Sat.</i> iii. 17.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In imitating this passage, Mr. Rhodes, finding no fons
Egeri&aelig;, no Numa, and perhaps no Muses in London, transfers
his regrets from a rivulet to a navigable stream; and makes the
whole ridiculous, by suggesting that the Thames would look
infinitely better if it flowed through grass, as every ordinary
brook would do.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Next he departed to the river side,</p>
<p>Crowded with buildings, tow'ring in their pride.</p>
<p>How much, much better would this river look,</p>
<p>Flowing 'twixt grass, like every other brook,</p>
<p>If native sand its tedious course beguil'd,</p>
<p>Nor any foreign ornament defil'd."</p>
</div>

<h3>DEDICATION TO MILTON BY ANTONIO MALATESTI.</h3>
<p>Dr. Todd, in his <i>Life of Milton</i>, ed. 1826, mentions the
accidental discovery of a manuscript by Antonio Malatesti, bearing
the following title:</p>
<p>"La Tina Equivoci Rusticali di Antonio Malatesti, c[=o]posti
nella sua Villa di Taiano il Settembre dell' Anno 1637. Sonetti
Cinqu[=a]nta. Dedicati al' III'mo Signore et Padrone Oss'mo Signor
Giovanni Milton, Nobil' Inghilese."</p>
<p>It seems that this MS. had been presented, together with
Milton's works, to the Academy della Crusca, by Mr. Brand Hollis,
but had by some chance again found its way to England, and was sold
by auction at Evans's some short time before Mr. Todd published
this second edition of Milton's Life.</p>
<p>I know not if there has been any further notice of this MS.,
which is interesting as a monument of the respect and attention our
great poet received from the most distinguished literary men of
Italy at the time of his visit, and I should be glad if any of your
correspondents can indicate its existence, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>{147}</span> and the
place where it is now preserved. When it was on sale, I had
permission to copy the title and a few of the sonnets, which were
such as we could not imagine would have given pleasure to the
chaste mind of Milton; each of them containing, as the title
indicates, an <i>&eacute;quivoque</i>, which would bear an obscene
sense, yet very ingeniously wrapped up. The first sonnet opens
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Queste Sonnetti, o Tina, ch' i' h&oacute; composto,</p>
<p>Me gl' h&aacute; dettati una Musa buffona,</p>
<p>Cantando d' improviso, alla Carlona,</p>
<p>Sul suono, spinto dal oalor del Mosto."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The second may serve to show the nature of the
<i>&eacute;quivoque</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Tina, I' so legger bene, e rilevato</p>
<p>La Storia di Liombrune, e Josafatte,</p>
<p>Se ben, per esser noto in queste fratte</p>
<p>Sotto il Maestro mai non sono stato.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"E il lere del dificio m' ha giurato,</p>
<p>Quand' egli ha visto le Poesie ch' i' h&oacute; fatte,</p>
<p>Ch' elle son belle, e i piedi in terra batte,</p>
<p>E vuol ch' io mi sia in Pisa adottorato.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Io canto, quand' io son ben ben satollo,</p>
<p>Sul Chitarrin con voce si sottile,</p>
<p>Ch'io ne disgrado insien Maestro Apollo.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Vien un poco da me, Tina gentile,</p>
<p>Che s' egli avvien che tu mi segga in collo,</p>
<p>M' sentirai ben tosto alzar lo stile."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Antonio Malatesti was a man of mark in his time, being
distinguished for his talent as an improvisatore. Among his friends
were Galileo, Coltellini, and Valerio Chimentelli, who have all
commendatory poems prefixed to Malatesti's "Sphinx," a collection
of poetical enigmas, which has been frequently reprinted. Beside
his poetical talent, he studied astronomy, probably under Galileo;
and painting, in which he was a pupil of Lorenzo Lippi, author of
the "Malmantile Raqquistato," who thus designates him under his
academical name of <i>Amostante Latoni</i> (canto i. stanza
61.):&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"E General di tutta questa Mandra</p>
<p>Amostante Laton Poeta insigne.</p>
<p>Canta improviso, come un Calandra:</p>
<p>Stampa gli Enigmi, 'Strologia, e Dipigne."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Malatesti was a member of the Academy degli Apatisti, of which
Milton's friends Coltellini and Carlo Dati had been the principal
founders. The house of the latter was a court of the Muses, and it
was at the evening parties there that all who were distinguished
for science or literature assembled: "Era in Firenze la sua Casa la
Magione de' Letterati, particolarmente Oltramontani, da lui
ricevuti in essa, e trattati con ogni sorta di gentilezza."<a id=
"footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> Heinsius, Menage, Chapelain, and
other distinguished foreigners were members of this academy; and it
is more than probable that, were its annals consulted, our poet's
name would also be found there.</p>

him a period of pure enjoyment, and seems to have been always
remembered with delight:&mdash;"Illa in urbe, quam prae ceteris

<h3>PULTENEY'S BALLAD OF "THE HONEST JURY."</h3>
<p>On the application for a new trial, in the case of The King
<i>against</i> William Davies Shipley, Dean of St. Asaph (1784),
wherein was raised the important and interesting question, whether
in libel cases the jury were judges of the law as well as the fact,
Lord Mansfield, in giving judgment, remarked in reference to trials
for libel, before Lord Raymond:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I by accident (from memory only I speak now) recollect one
where the <i>Craftsman</i> was acquitted; and I recollect it from a
famous, witty, and ingenious ballad that was made at the time by
Mr. Pulteney; and though it is a ballad, I will cite the stanza I
remember from it, because it will show you the idea of the able men
in opposition, and the leaders of the popular party in those days.
They had not an idea of assuming that the jury put it upon another
and much better ground. The stanza I allude to is this:&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'For Sir Philip well knows,</p>
<p class="i2">That his <i>innuendos</i></p>
<p>Will serve him no longer,</p>
<p class="i2">In verse or in prose;</p>
<p>For twelve honest men have decided the cause,</p>
<p>Who are judges of fact, though not judges of laws.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was the admission of the whole of that party; they put it
right; they put it upon the meaning of the <i>innuendos</i>; upon
<i>that</i> the jury acquitted the defendant; and they never put up
a pretence of any other power, except when talking to the jury
themselves."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Howell's <i>State Trials</i> (xxi. 1038.) is a note on this
passage. This note (stated to be from the <i>Speeches of Hon.
Thomas Erskine</i>) is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appears by a pamphlet printed in 1754, that Lord Mansfield
is mistaken. The verse runs thus:&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'Sir Philip well knows,</p>
<p class="i2">That his innuendos</p>
<p>Will serve him no longer in verse or in prose:</p>

<p>Lord Campbell, in his <i>Lives of the Chancellors</i> (v. 25.)
and <i>Lives of the Lord Chief Justices</i> (ii. 543.), and Mr.
Harris, in his <i>Life of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke</i> (i. 221.),
give the lines as quoted by Lord Mansfield, with the exception of
the last and only important line, which they give, after the note
to Erskine's speeches, as</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Who are judges alike of the facts and the laws."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And Lord Campbell (who refers to <i>State Trials</i>, xxi.) says
that Lord Mansfield, in the Dean of St. Asaph's Case, misquoted the
lines "to suit his purpose, or from lapse of memory."</p>
<p>I know not what is the pamphlet referred to as printed in 1754;
but on consulting the song itself, as given in the 5th volume of
the <i>Craftsman</i>, 337., and there entitled "The Honest Jury;
or, Caleb Triumphant. To the tune of 'Packington's Pound,'" I find
not only that Lord Mansfield's recollection of the stanza he
referred to was substantially correct, but that the opinion in
support of which he cited it is expressed in another stanza besides
that which he quoted. The first verse of the song is as
follows:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Rejoice, ye good writers, your pens are set free;</p>
<p>Your thoughts and the <i>press</i> are at full liberty;</p>
<p>For your <i>king</i> and your <i>country</i> you safely may
write,</p>
<p>You may say <i>black</i> is <i>black</i>, and prove <i>white</i>
is <i>white</i>;</p>
<p class="i2">Let no pamphleteers</p>
<p class="i2">Be concerned for their ears;</p>
<p class="i2">For every man now shall be tried by his
<i>peers</i>.</p>
<p><i>Twelve good honest men</i> shall decide in each cause,</p>
<p>And be judges of <i>fact</i>, tho' not judges of
<i>laws</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the third verse are the lines Lord Mansfield cited from
memory:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"For Sir Philip well knows</p>
<p class="i2">That <i>innuen-does</i></p>
<p>Will serve him no longer in verse or in prose;</p>
<p>Since <i>twelve honest men</i> have decided the cause,</p>
<p>And were judges of <i>fact</i>, tho' not judges of
<i>laws</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lord Campbell and Mr. Harris both make another mistake with
reference to this ballad which I may perhaps be excused if I
notice. They say that it was composed on an unsuccessful
prosecution of the <i>Craftsman</i> by Sir Philip Yorke, and that
this unsuccessful prosecution was subsequent to the successful
prosecution of that paper on December 3rd, 1731. This was not so:
Sir Philip Yorke's unsuccessful prosecution, and to which of course
Pulteney's ballad refers, was in 1729, when Francklin was tried for
printing "The Alcayde of Seville's Speech," and, as the song
indicates, acquitted.</p>

observes that "the form and subject, rather than the imagery, is
copied." In the following maledictory address from Ph. Fletcher's
2nd eclogue, st. 23., the imagery is precisely similar to Milton's,
the good and evil being made to consist in the fulness or decrease
of the water, the clearness or muddiness of the stream, and the
nature of the plants flowing on its banks:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>"But thou, proud Chame, which thus hast wrought me spite,</p>

<p>A year or two ago I was staying in Somersetshire, and having a
wart myself, was persuaded to have it "charmed." The
village-charmer was summoned; he first cut off a slip of
elder-tree, and made a notch in it for every wart. He then rubbed
the elder against each, strictly enjoining me to think no more
about it, as if I looked often at the warts the charm would
fail.</p>
<p>In about a week the warts had altogether disappeared, to the
delight of the operator.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON COLLEGE SALTING; TURKISH SPY; DR. DEE; FROM "LETTERS
FROM THE BODLEIAN, &amp;c." 2 VOLS. 1813.</h3>
<p>Having been lately reading through this interesting collection,
I have "noted" some references to subjects which have been
discussed in your columns.</p>
<p>1. <i>College Salting. Salt at Eton Montem</i> (Vol. i., pp.
261. 306. 321. 384. 390. 492.).&mdash;I am not quite clear as to
the connection between these two subjects: but an identity of
origin is not improbable. A letter from Mr. Byrom to Aubrey, "On
the Custom of Salting at Eton," Nov. 15. 1693, is in vol. ii. p.
167.:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id=
"page151"></a>{151}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>"I could send you a long answer to your queries, but have not
the confidence to do it; for all that I can say was only heard from
others when I was at school at Eton, and if I should depend upon
that, perhaps I should make too bold with truth. 'Twas then
commonly said that the college held some lands by the custom of
salting; but having never since examined it, I know not how to
account for it. One would think, at first view, considering the
foundation was designed for a nursery of the Christian religion,
and has not been in being much above 250 years, that it is not
likely any remains of the Gentiles, relating to their sacrifices,
should in so public a manner be suffered in it; however, I cannot
but own with those that understand anything of antiquity, that the
Christians very early assumed some rites of the heathens; and
probably it might be done with this design,&mdash;that the nations,
seeing a religion which in its outward shape was something like
their own, might be the sooner pursuaded to embrace it. To be free,
sir, with you, I am apt to believe, for the honour of that society
of which I was once an unworthy member, that the annual custom of
salting alludes to that saying of our Saviour to His disciples,
'<i>Ye are the salt of the earth</i>;' for as salt draws up all
that matter that tends to putrefaction, so it is a symbol of our
doing the like in a spiritual state, by taking away all natural
corruption.... If this will not please, why may it not denote that
wit and knowledge by which boys dedicated to learning ought to
distinguish themselves. You know what <i>sal</i> sometimes
signifies among the best Roman authors: <i>Publius Scipio omnes
sale facetiisque superabat</i>, Cic.; and Terent, <i>Qui habet
salem qui in te est</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Editor has a note on this letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There have been various conjectures relative to the origin of
this custom. Some have supposed that it arose from an ancient
practice among the friars of selling consecrated salt and others,
with more probability, from the ceremony of the <i>bairn</i> or
<i>boy</i>-bishop, as it is said to have been formerly a part of
the Montem-celebration for prayers to be read by a boy dressed in
the clerical habit."</p>

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>
<p><i>Alarm</i>.&mdash;A man is indicted for striking at the Queen,
with intent (among other things) to <i>alarm</i> her Majesty. It
turns out that the very judge has forgotten the legal (which is
also the military) meaning of the word. An alarm is originally the
signal to arm: Query, Is it not formed from the cry <i>&agrave;
l'arme</i>, which in modern times is <i>aux armes</i>? The judge
said that from the courage of her family, most likely the Queen was
not alarmed, meaning, not frightened. But the illegal intent to
alarm merely means the intent to make another think that it is
necessary to take measures of defence or protection. When an
<i>alarm</i> is sounded, the soldier who is <i>not</i> alarmed is
the one who would be held to be frightened.</p>
<p class="author">M.</p>
<p><i>Taking a Wife on Trial</i>.&mdash;The following note was made
upon reading <i>The Historical and Genealogical Account of the Clan
of Maclean</i>, by a Seneachie, published by Smith, Elder, and Co.,
London, 1838. It may be thought worthy of a corner amongst the
Notes on Folk Lore, which form so curious and entertaining a
portion of the "NOTES AND QUERIES."</p>
<p>In the beginning of the year 1608 a commission, consisting of
the Archbishop of Glasgow, the Bishop of the Isles (Andrew Knox),
Andrew Stewart, Lord Ochiltree, and Sir James Hay of Kingask,
proceeded to the Isles with power to summon the chiefs to a
conference, for the purpose of intimating to them the measures in
contemplation by the government. A meeting for this purpose was
held at Aross Castle, one of the seats of Maclean, in Mull, at
which the principal barons and heads of houses attended.</p>
<p>The regulations contemplated had for their object the
introduction of an additional number of pious divines, who were to
be provided for out of the lands of the great island proprietors;
the abolishing a certain remarkable custom which till then
prevailed, namely, that of taking a wife on approbation, or, in
plain intelligible terms, <i>on trial</i>!</p>
<p>The following are two examples recorded of this singular
custom.</p>
<p>John Mac-Vic Ewen, fourth laird of Ardgour, had
<i>handfasted</i> (as it was called) with a daughter of Mac Ian of
Ardnamurchan, whom he had taken on a promise of marriage, if she
pleased him. At the expiration of two years he sent her home to her
father; but his son by her, the gallant John of Invorscaddel, a son
of Maclean of Ardgour, celebrated in the history of the Isles, was
held to be an illegitimate offspring by virtue of the "handfast
ceremony."</p>
<p>Another instance is recorded of a Macneil of Borra having for
several years enjoyed the society of a lady of the name of Maclean
on the same principle; but his offspring by her were deprived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id=
"page152"></a>{152}</span> of their inheritance by the issue of his
subsequent marriage with a lady of the Clanrannald family.</p>
<p>These decisions no doubt tended to the abolition of a custom or
principle so subversive of marriage and of the legitimacy of
offspring.</p>

<p>Worcester, July 19.</p>
<p><i>Russian Language</i>.&mdash;A friend of mine, about to go to
Russia, wrote to me some time since, to ask if he could get a
<i>Russian grammar in English, or any English books bearing on the
language</i>. I told him I did not think there were any; but would
make inquiry. Dr. Bowring, in his <i>Russian Anthology</i>, states
as a remarkable fact, that the first Russian grammar ever published
was published in England. It was entitled <i>H.W. Ludolfi
Grammatica Russica qu&aelig; continet et Manuductionem quandum ad
Grammaticam Slavonicam</i>. Oxon. 1696. The Russian grammar next to
this, but published in its own language, was written by the great
Lomonosov, the father of Russian poetry, and the renovator of his
mother tongue: I know not the year, but it was about the middle of
the last century. I have a German translation of this grammar "Von
Johann Lorenz Stuvenhagen: St. Petersburgh, 1764." Grotsch, Jappe,
Adelung, &amp;c., have written on the Russian language. Jappe's
grammar, Dr. Bowring says, is the best he ever met with. I must
make a query here with regard to Dr. Bowring's delightful and
highly interesting <i>Anthologies</i>. I have his Russian, Dutch,
and Spanish <i>Anthologies</i>: <i>Did he ever publish any
others</i>? I have not met with them. I know he contemplated
writing translations from Polish, Servian, Hungarian, Finnish,
Lithonian, and other poets.</p>

<p><i>Pistol and Bardolph</i>.&mdash;I am glad to be able to
transfer to your pages a Shakspearian note, which I met with in a
periodical now defunct. It appears from an old MS. in the British
Museum, that amongst canoniers serving in Normandy in 1436, were
"Wm. Pistail&mdash;R. Bardolf." Query, Were these common English
names, or did these identical canoniers transmit a traditional
fame, good or bad, to the time of Shakspeare, in song or story?</p>
<p>If this is a well-known Query, I should be glad to be referred
to a solution of it, if not, I leave it for inquiry.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>CALVIN AND SERVETUS.</h3>
<p>The fate of Servetus has always excited the deepest
commiseration. His death was a judicial crime, the rank offence of
religious pride, personal hatred, and religious fanaticism. It
borrowed from superstition its worst features, and offered
necessity the tyrant's plea for its excuse. Every detail of such
events is of great interest. For by that immortality of mind which
exists for ever as History, or through the agency of those
successive causes which still link us to it by their effects, we
are never separated from the Past. There is also an eloquence in
immaterial things which appeals to the heart through all ages. Is
there a man who would enter unmoved the room in which Shakspeare
was born, in which Dante dwelt, or see with indifference the desk
at which Luther wrote, the porch beneath which Milton sat, or Sir
Isaac Newton's study? So also the possession of a book once their
own, still more of the MS. of a work by which great men won
enduring fame, written in a great cause, for which they struggled
and for which they suffered, seems to efface the lapse of
centuries. We feel present before them. They are before us as
living witnesses. Thus we see Servetus as, alone and on foot, he
arrived at Geneva in 1553; the lake and the little inn, the
"Auberge de la Rose," at which he stopped, reappear pictured by the
influence of local memory and imagination. From his confinement in
the old prison near St. Peter's, to the court where he was accused,
during the long and cruel trial, until the fatal eminence of
Champel, every event arises before us, and the air is peopled with
thick coming visions of the actors and sufferer in the dreadful
scene. Who that has read the account of his death has not heard, or
seemed to hear, that shriek, so high, so wild, alike for mercy and
of dread despair, which when the fire was kindled burst above
through smoke and flame,&mdash;"that the crowd fell back with a
shudder!" Now it strikes me, an original MS. of the work for which
he was condemned still exists; and I, thinking that others may feel
the interest I have tried to sketch in its existence, will now
state the facts of the case, and lay my authorities before your
readers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We condemn you, said the council, Michael Servetus, to be bound
and led to Champel, where you are to be fastened to a stake, and
burnt alive together with your book, as well the printed as the
MS."</p>
<p>"About midday he was led to the stake. An iron chain encompassed
his body; on his head was placed a crown of plaited straw and
leaves strewed with sulphur, to assist in suffocating him. At his
girdle were suspended his printed books; and the MS. he had sent to
Calvin."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This MS. had been completed in 1546, and sent to Geneva for his
opinion. Calvin, in a letter to Farel says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Servetus wrote to me lately, and accompanied his letter with a
long volume <i>of his insanities</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This long volume was the MS. of the "Restitutio Christianismi,"
now ready for the press. We <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"
id="page153"></a>{153}</span> have seen that it was sent to Calvin.
It was never returned, but produced in evidence, and burnt with him
at the stake. Nevertheless, he either possessed another copy or
took the pains of writing it afresh, and thus the work was secretly
printed at Vienna, at the press of Balshazar Arnoullet in 1553. Of
this edition, those at Frankfort were burnt at the instance of
Calvin; at Geneva, Robert Stephens sacrificed all the copies which
had come into his hands; so that of an edition of one thousand, it
is said only six copies were preserved. These facts I owe to the
excellent Life of Calvin by Mr. T.H. Dyer, recently published by
Mr. Murray. Now does the following MS. bear relation to that
described as recopied by Servetus, from which Arnoullet printed? or
is it the first rough sketch? Can any of your readers say into what
collection it passed?</p>
<p>The extract is from the Catalogue of the Library of Cisternay
Dufay, by Gabriel Martin, Paris, 8vo. 1725, being lot 764., p. 98.,
and was sold for 176 livres.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Librorum Serveti de Trinitate Codex MS. autographus. In fronte

<p><i>Countess of Desmond</i>.&mdash;I should be much obliged if
any of your readers would inform me of the manner of the death of
Catherine Fitzgerald, Countess of Desmond, commonly called the "old
Countess of Desmond," who died in 1626, aged above 140
years,&mdash;some say, 162 years. I think I remember reading, some
years since, that she died from a fall from a cherry-tree, at the
age of 144 years. If so, where can the account be found?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"With antique pillars massy <i>proof</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now what is "proof,"&mdash;a substantive or adjective? If the
latter, no edition is rightly stopped; for, of course, there should
be a comma after "massy;" and then I somewhat doubt the propriety
of "proof" for "proved," unless joined with another word, as
"star-proof," "rain-proof."</p>
<p>If "proof" is a substantive, "massy proof" is in apposition to
"antique pillars," and is very meaningless. Can any of your readers
suggest an explanation?</p>
<p class="author">H.A.B.</p>

correspondent D.V.S. may be able to throw some light upon "Mooney."
Let me add that D.V.S. has perhaps somewhat misconceived my brief
comment on Ludlam, which my regard for conciseness has left some
deal obscure; and it does not appear worth while to go over the
ground again. I repeatedly heard "Dick's hat-band" quoted by
Lancashire friends exactly as given by Southey. Does not the
variation "cobbler's dog" tend to prove the alliterative principle
for which I had been contending?</p>

<h2>REPLIES</h2>
<h3>TOBACCO IN THE EAST.</h3>
<p>In the <i>Edinburgh Cabinet Library</i>, vol. iii. p. 383., art.
"China," it is stated that three species of tobacco have been found
in India and in China, under circumstances which can leave no doubt
of their being native plants.</p>
<p>Dr. Bigelow (<i>American Botany</i>, 4to., vol. ii. p. 171.)
tells us that <i>Nicot. fructicosa</i> is said to have been
cultivated in the East prior to the discovery of America.
Linn&aelig;us sets down the same as a native of China and the Cape
of Good Hope. Sir G. Staunton says that there is no traditional
account of the introduction of tobacco into China; nor is there any
account of its introduction into India<a id="footnotetag2" name=
"footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>; though,
according to Barrow, the time when the cotton plant was introduced
into the southern provinces of China is noted in their annals. Bell
of Antermony, who was in China in 1721, says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is reported the Chinese have had the use of tobacco for many
ages," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Travels</i>, vol. ii. p. 73., Lond. ed.
4to. 1763.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ledyard says, the Tartars have smoked from remote antiquity
(<i>Travels</i>, 326.). Du Halde speaks of tobacco as one of the
natural productions of Formosa, whence it was largely imported by
the Chinese (p. 173. Lond. ed. 8vo. 1741).</p>
<p>The prevalence of the practice of smoking at an early period
among the Chinese is appealed to by Pallas as one evidence that in
Asia, and especially in China, the use of tobacco for smoking is
more ancient than the discovery of the New World. (See <i>Asiat.
Journ</i>., vol. xxii. p. 137.)</p>
<p>The Koreans say they received tobacco from Japan, as also
instructions for its cultivation, about the latter end of the
sixteenth century. (Authority, I think, Hamel's <i>Travels, Pink.
Coll.</i>, vii. 532.) Loureiro states that in Cochin China tobacco
is indigenous, and has its proper vernacular name.</p>
<p>Java is said to have possessed it before 1496. Dr. Ruschenberg
says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are informed the Portuguese met with it on their first visit
to Java."&mdash;<i>Voy. of U.S.S. Peacock</i>, vol. ii. p. 456,
Lond. ed. 8vo. 1838.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crauford dates its introduction into Java, 1601, but admits that
the natives had traditions of having possessed it long before.
(<i>Indian Archipelago</i>, vol. i. pp. 104. 409, 410. 8vo.)
Rumphius, in the latter part of the seventeenth century, found it
universal even where the Portuguese and Spaniards had never
been.</p>
<p>Savary, in his <i>Parfait N&eacute;gociant</i>, states that the
Persians have used tobacco 400 years, and probably received it from
Egypt. (See <i>Med. Chir. Review</i>, 1840, p. 335.)</p>
<p>Olearius found it fully established in Persia, 1637, only about
fifty years after its arrival in England. (Lond. 1662, in fol. p.
322.) Chardin states, the Persians smoked long before the discovery
of America, and had cultivated tobacco time immemorial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Coffee without tobacco is meat without salt."&mdash;Persian
Proverb, Sale's <i>Koran</i>, Preliminary Discourse, 169. ed.
8vo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1634 Olearius found the Russians so addicted to tobacco that
they would spend their money on it rather than bread. (See edit.
above quoted, lib. iii. p. 83.)</p>
<p>According to Prof. Lichtenstein, the Beetjuanen smoked and
snuffed long before their intercourse with Europeans. (<i>Med. and
Chir. Rev.</i>, 1840, p. 335.)</p>
<p>Liebault, in his <i>Maison Rustique</i>, asserts that he found
tobacco growing naturally in the forest of Ardennes. Libavius says
that it grows in the Hyrcinian forest. (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>
<p>Dr. Cleland shows the three last to be falsehoods(?).</p>
<p>Ysbrants Ides found tobacco in general use among the Ostiaks and
other tribes passed in his route to China, 1692. (Harris's
<i>Coll.</i>, fol. vol. ii. pp. 925. and 926.)</p>
<p>The story told of Amurath IV. punishing a Turk for smoking seems
to be a mistake, since Amurath only began to reign 1622; whereas
Sandys relates the same story of a certain Morad Bassa, probably
Murat III., who began to reign <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page155" id="page155"></a>{155}</span> 1576, and ended 1594. If
this be the case, the Turks were smokers before tobacco was known
in England.&mdash;In Persia smoking was prohibited by Shah Abbas.
There were two princes of this name. The first began his reign 1585
A.D., died 1628: the second began 1641, died 1666. The proclamation
against smoking was probably issued by the first, since (as before
mentioned) in 1634 Olearius found the custom firmly established. If
so, the Persians must have been early smokers. Smoking seems to
have obtained at a very remote period among several nations of
antiquity. Dr. Clarke quotes Plutarch on Rivers to show that the
Thracians were in the habit of intoxicating themselves with smoke,
which he supposes to have been tobacco. The <i>Quarterly Review</i>
is opposed to this.</p>
<p>Lafitau quotes Pomp. Mela and Solin to show the same; also
Herodotus and Maximin of Tyre, as evidences to the same custom
prevailing amongst the Scythians, and thinks that Strabo alludes to
tobacco in India. (See, for the Scythians, the <i>Universal
History</i>.) Logan, in his <i>Celtic Gaul</i>, advances that
smoking is of great antiquity in Britain. He says that pipes of the
Celts are frequently found, especially at Brannocktown, co.
Kildare, where in 1784 they were dug up in great numbers; that a
skeleton dug out of an ancient barrow, actually had a pipe sticking
between its teeth when found. (From <i>Anthol. Hibern.</i>, i.
352.) Halloran says Celtic pipes are found in the Bog of Cullen. In
form, these pipes were very similar to those in use at this
day.</p>
<p>Eulia Effendi mentions having found a tobacco pipe, still in
good preservation, and retaining a smell of smoke, embeded in the
wall of a Grecian edifice more ancient than the birth of Mahomet.
(<i>Med. Chir. Rev.</i> 1840, p. 335.) This Dr. Cleland proves to
be a lie(?). He proves the same of Chardin, Bell of Antermony, Mr.
Murray, Pallas, Rumphius, Savary, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Masson describes a "chillum," or smoking apparatus, found
embedded in an ancient wall in Beloochistan. (<i>Travels</i>, ii.
157.)</p>
<p>Dr. Yates saw amongst the paintings in a tomb at Thebes the
representation of a smoking party. (<i>Travels in Egypt</i>, ii.
412.)</p>
<p>There is an old tradition in the Greek Church, said to be
recorded in the works of the early Fathers, of the Devil making
Noah drunk with tobacco, &amp;c. (Johnson's <i>Abyssinia</i>, vol.
ii. p. 92.)</p>
<p>Nanah, the prophet of the Sikhs, was born 1419. Supposing him
fifty when he published his <i>Ordinances</i>, it would bring us to
1469, or 23 years before the discovery of America by Columbus. In
these <i>Ordinances</i> he forbade the use of tobacco to the Sikhs;
but found the habit so deeply rooted in the Hind&ucirc; that he
made an exception in their favour. (Masson's <i>Beloochistan</i>,
vol. i. p. 42.) Should this be true, the Hind&ucirc; must have been
in the habit of smoking long before the discovery of America, to
have acquired so inveterate a predilection for it.</p>
<p>If the prophecy attributed to Mahomet be not a fabrication of
after times, it is strongly corroborative, and goes to show that he
was himself acquainted with the practice of smoking, viz.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To the latter day there shall be men who will bear the name of
Moslem, but will not be really such, and they shall smoke a certain
weed which shall be called tobacco."&mdash;See Sale's <i>Koran</i>,
ed. 8vo. p. 169.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Query. Is tobacco the word in the original? If so, it is a
stumbling-block.</p>
<p>Lieut. Burns, in his <i>Travels</i>, has the following curious
statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The city of Alore was the capital of a great empire extending
from Cachemere to the sea. This was conquered by the Mahomedans in
the seventh century, and in the decisive battle they are reported
to have brought fire, &amp;c., in their pipes to frighten the
elephants."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lieut. Burns conjectures that they must have smoked bang,
&amp;c., tobacco being then unknown.</p>
<p>Buchanan's account of the cultivation and preparation of tobacco
in Mysore, carries with it a conviction that these elaborate
processes were never communicated to them by Europeans, nor brought
in any way from America, where they have never been practised. They
strike one as peculiarly ancient and quite indigenous.</p>
<p>The rapid dissemination of tobacco, as also of forms and
ceremonies connected with its use; its already very extensive
cultivation in the remotest parts of the continent and islands of
Asia, within a century of its introduction into Europe, amounts to
the miraculous; and particularly when we see new habits of life,
and novelties in their ceremonies of state, at once adopted and
become familiar, to such otherwise unchangeable people as the
orientals are known to be. Extraordinary also is the fact that the
forms and ceremonies adopted should so precisely coincide (in most
respects) with those in use among the American Indians, and should
not be found in any of the intermediate countries through which we
must suppose them to have passed. Who taught them the presentation
of the pipe to guests, a form so strictly observed by the Red Men
of America, &amp;c.? But the "narghile," the "kaleoon," the
"hookah," the "hubble-bubble," whence came they? They are
indigenous.</p>
<p>Great stress is laid on the silence of Marco Polo,
Rubruquis,&mdash;the two Mahomedans, Drake, Cavendish, and
Pigafelta; also of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, on the subject of
smoking,&mdash;and with reason; but, after all, it is negative
evidence: for we have examples of the same kind the other way. Sir
Henry Blount, who was in Turkey in 1634, describes manners and
customs very minutely without a single allusion to smoking, though
we know <span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id=
"page156"></a>{156}</span> that twenty years previously to that
date the Turks were inveterate smokers. M. Adr. Balbi insists
likewise on the prevalence of the Ha&iuml;tian name "tambaku" being
conclusive as to the introduction of tobacco from America. This,
however, is not exactly the case: in many countries of the East it
has vernacular names. In Ceylon it is called "dun-kol" or
smoke-leaf; in China, "tharr"&mdash;Barrow says, "yen."</p>
<p>The Yakuti (and Tungusi?) call it "schaar." The Crim Tartars
call it "t&uuml;t&uuml;n." The Koreans give it the name of the
province of Japan whence they first received it. In the Tartar
(Calmuc and Bashkir?) "gansa" is a tobacco-pipe. In America itself
tobacco has many names, viz. "goia," "gozobba" or "cohobba,"
"petun," "y'ouly," "yoly," and "uppwoc." Are there any proofs of
its growing wild in America? At the discovery it was every where
found in a state of cultivation. The only mention I have met with
is in Drake's <i>Book of the Indians</i><a id="footnotetag3" name=
"footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>, where he
says it grew spontaneously at Wingandacoa<a id="footnotetag4" name=
"footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and was
called by the natives "uppewoc." Does not this very notice imply
something unusual? and might not this have been a deserted
plantation?</p>
<p>The Indians have always looked to Europeans for presents of
tobacco, which they economise by mixing with willow-bark, the
uva-ursi, &amp;c., and there are some tribes totally unacquainted
with its use. M'Kenzie says, the Chepewyans learnt smoking from
Europeans, and that the Slave and Dogrib Indians did not even know
the use of tobacco.</p>
<p>In mentioning the silence of early visitors to the East on the
subject of smoking, I might have added equally the silence of the
Norwegian visitors to America on the same subject.</p>

<p>The tobacco-plant does not appear to be indigenous to any part
of Asia. Sir John Chardin, who was in Persia about the year 1670,
relates in his travels, that tobacco had been cultivated there from
time immemorial. "Honest John Bell" (of Antermony), who travelled
in China about 1720, asserts that it is reported the Chinese have
had the use of tobacco for many ages. Rumphius, who resided at
Amboyna towards the end of the seventeenth century, found it
universal over the East Indies, even in countries where Spaniards
or Portuguese had never been. The evidence furnished by these
authors, although merely traditional, is the strongest which I am
aware of in favour of an Asiatic origin for the use of tobacco.</p>
<p>Mr. Lane, on the other hand, speaks of the "introduction of
tobacco into the East, in the beginning of the seventeenth century
of our era," (<i>Arabian Nights</i>, Note 22. cap. iii.), "a fact
that has been completely established by the researches of Dr. Meyer
of Konigsberg, who discovered in the works of an old Hindostanee
physician a passage in which tobacco is distinctly stated to have
been introduced into India by the Frank nations in the year 1609."
(Vide <i>An Essay on Tobacco</i>, by H.W. Cleland, M.D. 4to.
Glasgow, 1840, to which I am indebted for the information embodied
in this reply to Z.A.Z., and to which I would beg to refer him for
much curious matter on the subject of tobacco.)</p>
<p>My own impression is, that the common use of <i>hemp</i> in the
East, for intoxicating purposes, from a very early period, has been
the cause of much of the misconception which prevails with regard
to the supposed ante-European employment of "tobacco, divine, rare,
super-excellent tobacco," in the climes of the East.</p>

<h3>"JOB'S LUCK," BY COLERIDGE.</h3>
<p>These lines (see Vol. ii., p. 102.) are printed in the collected
editions of the poems of Coleridge. In an edition now before me, 3
vols. 12mo., Pickering, 1836, they occur at vol. ii. p. 147. As
printed in that place, there is one very pointed deviation from the
copy derived by Mr. Singer from the Crypt. The last line of the
first stanza runs thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"<i>And</i> the sly devil did not take his spouse."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for February, 1848, there is
a poem by Coleridge, entitled "The Volunteer Stripling," which I do
not find in the collected edition above mentioned. It was
contributed to the <i>Bath Herald</i>, probably in 1803; and stands
there with "S.T. Coleridge" appended in full. The first stanza runs
thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Yes, noble old warrior! this heart has beat high,</p>
<p>When you told of the deeds which our countrymen wrought;</p>
<p>O, lend me the sabre that hung by thy thigh,</p>
<p>And I too will fight as my forefathers fought."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I remember to have read the following version of the epigram
descriptive of the character of the world some twenty or thirty
years ago; but where, I have forgotten. It seems to me to be a
better <i>text</i> than either of those given by your
correspondents:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Oh, what a glorious world we live in,</p>
<p>To lend, to spend, or e'en to give in;</p>
<p>But to borrow, to beg, or to come at one's own,</p>
<p>'Tis the very worst world that ever was known."</p>

<h3>ECCIUS DEDOLATUS.</h3>
<p>Mr. S.W. Singer, for an agreeable introduction to whom I am
indebted to "Notes and Queries," having expressed a wish (Vol. ii.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id=
"page157"></a>{157}</span> p. 122.) "to see and peruse" the rare
and amusing satire, entitled <i>Eccius dedolatus, authore
Joanne-francisco Cottalembergio, Poeta Laureato</i>, I shall
willingly forward to him a quarto volume which contains two copies
of it, at any time that an opportunity may present itself. In the
meanwhile, he may not have any objection to hear that these are
copies of distinct impressions; neither of them intentionally
recording place or printer.</p>
<p>Four separate and curious woodcuts decorate the title-page of
one exemplar, which was certainly printed at Basil, apud Andream
Cratandrum. The topmost woodcut, dated 1519, is here misplaced; for
it should be at the bottom of the page, in which position it
appears when employed to grace the title of the facetious
<i>Responsio</i> of Simon Hess to Luther. The second copy is in
Gothic letter, and has typographical ornaments very similar to
those used at Leipsic in the same year. A peculiar colophon is
added in the Basle edition; and after the words "Impressum in
Utopia," a quondam possessor of the tract, probably its
contemporary, has written with indignation, "Stulte mentiris!" The
duplicate, which I suppose to be of Leipsic origin, concludes with
"Impressum per Agrippun Panoplium, Regis Persarum Bibliopolam L.
Simone Samaritano et D. Juda Schariottide Consulibus, in urbe
Lacernarum, apud confluentes Rhenum et Istrum."</p>
<p>Professor Ranke, referred to by Mr. Singer, was mistaken in
assigning "March, 1520," as the date of <i>Eccius dedolatus</i>.
The terms "Acta decimo Kalendas Marcii" are, I believe, descriptive
of Tuesday, the 20th of February, in that year.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Singer may be able to communicate some tidings
respecting the Apostolic Prothonotary Simon Hess, of whom I have
casually spoken. Natalis Alexander (<i>Hist. Eccles.</i>, viii.
105. Paris, 1699) attributes the humorous production which bears
his name ("Lege et ridebis," declares the original title-page) to
Luther himself, amongst whose works it may be seen (tom. ii, fol.
126-185. Witeb. 1551); and it is a disappointment to read in
Seckendorf, "Hessus <i>Simon</i>. Quis hic fuerit, compertum mihi
non est." (<i>Scholia sive Supplem ad Ind. i. Histor.</i>, sig. 1.
3. <i>Francof</i>. 1692.)</p>

<h3>Replies to Minor Queries.</h3>
<p><i>Hiring of Servants</i> (Vol. ii., p. 89.).&mdash;It was
provided by several old statutes, the first of which was passed in
1349, that all able-bodied persons who had no evident means of
subsistence should put themselves as labourers to any that would
hire them. In the following year were passed several other acts
relating to labourers, by one of which, 25 Edward III. stat. i. c.
i., entitled, "The Year and Day's Wages of Servants and Labourers
in Husbandry," it was enacted that ploughmen and all other
labourers should be hired to serve for the full year, or other
usual terms, and not by the day; and further,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That such labourers do carry openly in their hands, in market
towns, their instruments of labour, and be there hired in a public
place, and not privately."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For carrying into effect these provisions, it would be necessary
to have certain days, and a fixed place set apart for the hiring of
servants. In the former particular, no days would be so convenient
as feast days: they were well known, and were days commonly
computed from; they were, besides, holidays, and days for which
labourers were forbidden to receive wages (<i>see</i> 34 Edw. III.
c. 10. and 4 Henry IV. c. 14.); so that, although absent from
labour, they would lose no part of the scanty pittances allowed
them by act of parliament or settled by justices. As to the latter
requirement, no place was so public, or would so naturally suggest
itself, or be so appropriate, as the market-place.</p>
<p>Thus arose in our own land the custom respecting which W.J.
makes inquiry, and also our statute fairs, or statutes; thus called
on account of their reference to the various "Statutes of
Labourers." I was not aware that any usage to hire on all festivals
(for to such, I take it, your correspondent refers) still existed
in England. As to France, I am unable to speak; but it is not
improbable that a similar custom in that country may be due to
causes nearly similar.</p>

<p><i>George Herbert.</i>&mdash;J.R. FOX (Vol. ii., p. 103.) will
find in Major's excellent edition of Walton's <i>Lives</i> the
information he requires. At p. 346. it is stated that Mrs. Herbert,
the widow of George Herbert, was afterwards the wife of Sir Robert
Cook, of Highnam, in the county of Gloucester, Knt., eight years,
and lived his widow about fifteen; all which time she took a
pleasure in mentioning and commending the excellences of Mr. George
Herbert. She died in the year 1653, and lies buried at Highnam; Mr.
Herbert in his own church, under the altar, and covered with a
gravestone without any inscription.</p>
<p>And amongst the notes appended by Major to these <i>Lives</i>,
is the following additional notice of Herbert's burial-place. The
parish register of Bemerton states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. George Herbert, Esq., parson of Inggleston and Bemerton,
was buried the 3rd day of March, 1632."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Thus he lived and thus he died," says Walton, "like a saint,
unspotted of the world, full of almsdeeds, full of humility, and
all the examples of a virtuous life, which I cannot conclude better
than with this borrowed observation:</p>
<div class="poem">

<p><i>Lord Delamere</i> (Vol. ii., p. 104.).&mdash;In Mr. Thomas
Lyte's <i>Ancient Ballads and Songs</i>, 12mo. 1827, is a ballad,
taken down from tradition, entitled <i>Lord Delamere</i>. It begins
as follows, and though different from the opening lines given by
Mr. Peacock, I am inclined to think that it is another version of
the same ballad:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>In the parliament house,</p>
<p>A great rout has been there,</p>
<p>Betwixt our good king</p>
<p>And the Lord Delamere;</p>
<p>Says Lord Delamere</p>
<p>To his Majesty full soon,</p>
<p>Will it please you, my liege,</p>
<p>To grant me a boon?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After nine more stanzas, the editor remarks,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We have not, as yet, been able to trace out the historical
incident upon which the ballad appears to have been founded, yet
those curious in such matters may consult, if they list,
<i>Proceedings and Debates in the House of Commons for 1621 and
1622</i>, where they will find that some stormy debatings in these
several years have been agitated in Parliament regarding the corn
laws, which bear pretty close upon the leading features of the
above."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="author">Edward F. Rimbault.</p>
<p><i>Execution of Charles I.</i> (Vol. ii., p.
72.).&mdash;P.S.W.E. is referred to <i>An exact and most impartial
Accompt of the Indictment, Arraignment, Trial, and Judgment
(according to law), of twenty-nine Regicides, &amp;c.</i>,
1660.</p>
<p>Therein he will find minutes of the trial and <i>conviction</i>
of one "William Hulett, alias Howlett," on the charge of having
struck "the fatal blow." How far the verdict was consistent with
the evidence (or, indeed, the whole proceedings of that court with
the modern sense of justice), abler judges than I have long since
determined.</p>
<p>On behalf of the prisoner Hulett, witnesses ("not to be admitted
upon oath against the king") deposed that the common hangman,
Richard Brandon, had frequently confessed (though he had also
denied) that <i>he</i> had beheaded the king. One of these
depositions, that of William Cox, is so remarkable that I am
induced to transcribe it. If it be true, "Matfelonensis" is
certainly justified in saying, "We need hardly question that
Richard Brandon was the executioner."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>William Cox</i> examined.</p>
<p>"When my Lord Capell, Duke Hamilton, and the Earl of Holland,
were beheaded in the Palace-yard, in Westminster, my Lord Capell
asked the common hangman, said he, 'Did you cut off my master's
head?' 'Yes,' saith he. 'Where is the instrument that did it?' He
then brought the ax. 'Is this the same ax; are you sure?' said my
Lord. 'Yes, my Lord,' saith the hangman, 'I am very sure it is the
same.' My Lord Capell took the ax and kissed it, and gave him five
pieces of gold. I heard him say, 'Sirrah, wert thou not afraid?'
Saith the hangman, 'They made me cut it off, and I had thirty pound
for my pains.'"</p>

<p class="author">William Franks Mathews.</p>
<p><i>Charade</i> (Vol. ii., p. 120.).&mdash;I think I can answer
Mr. Gatty's Query as to the authorship of the charade in question.
A schoolfellow of mine at Charterhouse wrote the following:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"What's that which all love more than life,</p>
<p>Fear more than death or mortal strife;</p>
<p>That which contented men desire,</p>
<p>The poor possess, the rich require,</p>
<p>The miser spends, the spendthrift saves,</p>
<p>And all men carry to their graves?"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This was taken from the original copy, and it was certainly his
own invention while at school, and was written about five years
ago. I have not seen him since, and do not like therefore to give
his name.</p>
<p>While on the subject of charades, can any of your correspondents
inform me of either the authorship or the answer of the
following:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Sir Hilary charged at Agincourt&mdash;</p>
<p>Sooth! 'twas a fearful day!</p>
<p>The Rufflers of the camp and court</p>
<p>Had little time to pray.</p>
<p>'Tis said Sir Hilary utter'd there</p>
<p>Two syllables, by way of prayer&mdash;</p>
<p>The first to all the young and proud</p>
<p>Who'll see to-morrow's sun;</p>
<p>The next, with its cold and quiet cloud,</p>
<p>To those who'll meet a dewy shroud</p>
<p>Before to-day's is gone:</p>
<p>And both together to all bright eyes,</p>
<p>That weep when a warrior nobly dies."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I quote from recollection, so perhaps have omitted part, but
believe it to be pretty correct. I heard it at the same time as the
one quoted in No. 31., and believe both to be hoaxes, as no answer
I have heard (including that given in No. 35.) can be considered
satisfactory. The former charade was attributed at the time to the
late Archbishop of Canterbury, and it was reported that a reward of
100<i>l.</i> was promised for the correct answer, and I know that a
clergyman sent him an answer with that belief. Among the answers
suggested was "Tapir," taken in its various significations, which I
think was as near the mark as "Church," as given in No. 35.</p>
<p>I have never heard any answer suggested to Sir Hilary's
dissyllabic prayer.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the Preface are the initials W.W., making it clear
that Watson, the author of <i>Important Considerations</i> and the
<i>Quodlibets</i>, was the writer, and accounting for the
connection which seemed to exist between the <i>Discursus</i> and
the <i>Quodlibets</i>.</p>
<p>The two passages quoted by Bishop Andrewes (<i>Resp. ad
Apol.</i> pp. 7. 117.) are to be found in p. 13. But the question
now arises, from what earlier book the quotations are taken, as
they both appear in the <i>Sparing Discovery</i> in Latin, and not
in English? Did the Jesuits publish a work containing such
statements? or are we to accept them as their opinions only on the
authority of so bitter an opponent as Watson?</p>

<p>THE GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE AND HISTORICAL REVIEW.</p>
<p>An Historical Magazine has long been the great desideratum of
our literature. Amongst many periodical publications, each
appealing to some peculiar or exclusive class, no one has given
special attention to that branch of knowledge which engages the
feelings of all classes.</p>
<p>The Gentleman's Magazine has stepped forward to occupy this
vacant post. Arrangements have been effected to secure for its
pages contributions from gentlemen eminently conversant with the
various branches of historical study, and every endeavour is made
to render it a WORTHY ORGAN AND REPRESENTATIVE OF HISTORICAL AS
WELL AS OF ARCH&AElig;OLOGICAL LITERATURE. In its ORIGINAL
ARTICLES, historical questions are considered and discussed; in its

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
